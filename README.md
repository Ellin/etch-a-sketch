# etch-a-sketch

In this project, I made an etch-a-sketch inspired pixel art app. Moving over the pixel squares with the mouse progressively darkens the ink by 10%.

## Skills practiced 
Through this project, I practiced the following skills:

## Project status
While this app works on desktops, future plans include making it mobile friendly by allowing drawing via touch strokes.
